I'm **Abhirath Batra**, working as an Engineer in **Azure Networking at Microsoft**. In trying to figure out my path in life, I'v worked on an assortment of things, connected by the thread of Computer Science.

* In college, I was in a dual degree program with a Computer Science major and Research focus on Computational Natural Sciences. 
* My research and Masters' Thesis is in Computational Biology. I worked on Enhanced Sampling in Molecular Dynamics Simulations. I applied to grad school and almost made it. 
* So I started out as a Junior Research Fellow at TIFR Hyderabad, where I worked on using ML to relate genetic and environmental factors to addiction. I applied to grad school again and got rejected again. I figured, time to move to industry.
* I started out work at Elucidata, a start-up solving for data driven Drug-Target Discovery. I worked in a variety of roles including Data and Software related. I found that I enjoyed engineering the most!
* Now, I work at Azure Networking, specifically in **Azure Front Door** which is Microsoft's CDN offering!

I just enjoy chasing my curiosity and creating software, writing, and science are all means to that end. I enjoy writing about how I process life through the frameworks of science, statistics and probability that my training have lent me. In that pursuit, I'm extremely lucky to have found a life partner in Shilpa, who's finishing her PhD in biology. We bond over science, food and comfort TV like New Girl and The Office.
