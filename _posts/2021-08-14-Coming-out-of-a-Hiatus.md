## TLDR

Don't read this. It's sort of, just for me! This is a half sleepy, half drunk rambling to get back on the writing train!

## It's been a while...

... and the guilt, shame, and disappointment of not having kept my promise to myself to keep learning and keep posting have been gnawing at me. I thought of writing something a while back as I was learning a bit of Vue.js and exclaim how I had not written much since I was first, on a vacation in December, and then was VERY social for 6 weekends. Then I felt like asking, if I really wanted to do it, wouldn't I just do it?

I'm beginning to think of writing like working out. Once I have a rhythm, my body should want it enough for me to keep doing it even if I don't necessarily do a good job. 
The key, I felt was to keep writing, even if it is average stuff. 
More importantly, I think I must write even if it doesn't match the (self-declared) ethos of this blog, that of learning technical stuff and posting about it.

To that end, I hope this stream of consciousness to be the post post, that sets in motion, my writing for the coming year. 

I also want to set the tone to be able to write about anything that I feel like because I've found that my free time is spent thinking and doing more varied things. 

To REALLY shake things around, I'll also change the theme of this blog to look better!

The End!
