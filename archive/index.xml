There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of buzz in the computational science community discussing the ramifications of their work.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the buzz and are curious about protein folding, read on&amp;hellip; This post is supposed to capture the motivation and complexity of the problem for an audience familiar with STEM in some way.</description></item><item><title>I build therefore I am!</title><link>https://abhirathb.github.io/archive/i-build-therefore-i-am/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://abhirathb.github.io/archive/i-build-therefore-i-am/</guid><description>What am I doing?!
