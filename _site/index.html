      <h1 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h1>

<p>I’m <strong>Abhirath Batra</strong>, working as an Engineer in <strong>Azure Networking at Microsoft</strong>, and currently struggling to write an about page.</p>

<p>I was a part of a trans-disciplinary program at <strong>IIIT-Hyderabad</strong> where I studied Computer Science, and wrote a Thesis on <strong>Computational Simulations of bio-molecules</strong>. Excited by the possibilities of research in <strong>Computational Biology</strong>, I decided to apply for PhDs. I came close, but not enough. That lead me to work as a Reserch Fellow at <strong>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</strong>. Here, I tried to use <strong>Bayesian Neural Networks to study what genetic modifications related to susceptibility to addiction</strong>. I tried that PhD again, but didn’t get through. So I moved on to work at a Startup in my hometown of Delhi, called <strong>Elucidata</strong>. At Elucidata, I worked at a bunch of things, aligning with the goal of building a product that would enable scientists working in various stages of <strong>Drug-Target discovery to offload their computational workflows</strong>. I discovered there that the function that I enjoyed there the most was Engineering.</p>

<p>So here I am, having decided that I wanted to build software, to learn among the best at Microsoft!</p>
