# Hello World!

I'm **Abhirath Batra**, working as an Engineer in **Azure Networking at Microsoft**, and currently struggling to write an about page. 

I'v worked on an assortment of things including research problems in Computational Biology to Data science and Engineering at a startup solving for data driven Drug-Target Discovery. 

Now, I work at Azure Networking, running internal services that plug into the networking infrastructure of Microsoft's massive cloud service.

I like movies, astronomy, music, and of course, tech!

Find me on Twitter to talk about pretty much everything!
