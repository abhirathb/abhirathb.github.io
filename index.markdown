# Hello World!

I'm **Abhirath Batra**, working as an Engineer in **Azure Networking at Microsoft**, and currently struggling to write an about page. 

I was a part of a trans-disciplinary program at **IIIT-Hyderabad** where I studied Computer Science, and wrote a Thesis on **Computational Simulations of bio-molecules**. Excited by the possibilities of research in **Computational Biology**, I decided to apply for PhDs. I came close, but not enough. That lead me to work as a Reserch Fellow at **Tata Institute of Fundamental Research**. Here, I tried to use **Bayesian Neural Networks to study what genetic modifications related to susceptibility to addiction**. I tried that PhD again, but didn't get through. So I moved on to work at a Startup in my hometown of Delhi, called **Elucidata**. At Elucidata, I worked at a bunch of things, aligning with the goal of building a product that would enable scientists working in various stages of **Drug-Target discovery to offload their computational workflows**. I discovered there that the function that I enjoyed there the most was Engineering. 

So here I am, having decided that I wanted to build software, to learn among the best at Microsoft!
